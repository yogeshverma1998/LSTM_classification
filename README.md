# LSTM_classification

Classification of Multi-particle events using LSTM's and Convolutional Neural Networks.

# Data
Generated in Pythia8240
Data is stored in .txt files, where each line represents an event. Each event is comprised of a list of particle variables (pT, eta, phi), which are separated by commas.
The data is split into two folders, ATLAS-like (LHC) and STAR-like (RHIC). Each of those datasets coontaint MinBias (ND), Difr (SD+DD), SinDifr (SD) and DblDifr(DD).
